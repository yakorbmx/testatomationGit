We were 16, this means robbing was an option
Money was the problem, scrapping copper for some profit
Break it in for some gin, hope your mom don’t got a problem
Throw the bottle over the fence, and I hope nobody saw us We were gone, we were dead, resurrect and go to bed
Just some dirty white boys with some drugs up in our hands
Never slanging dope, no, cause we’d rather just smoke
Ice cold, back rolls, tires covered in snow

I’m taking it back to the basics, I’m bringing it back to the basement
See this that Christmas light shining, 101 blunts to the face, shit
See I was 15, drinking like I was fucking 32
All the things you and your friends do, I did that too
Broken glass, blunt ash, dashing away with the product
Peep it, flip it for some dollars, then we buy some more bottles
Our parents thinking that we missing, haven’t spoken some weeks
My shoes wet from the weather, hiding out from the heat
I’m just a young bad kid, wasn’t meant to do shit
I did things I wish I didn’t, I got things I wish I did
