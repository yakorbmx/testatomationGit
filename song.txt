We were 16, this means robbing was an option
Money was the problem, scrapping copper for some profit
Break it in for some gin, hope your mom don’t got a problem
Throw the bottle over the fence, and I hope nobody saw us We were gone, we were dead, resurrect and go to bed
Just some dirty white boys with some drugs up in our hands
Never slanging dope, no, cause we’d rather just smoke
Ice cold, back rolls, tires covered in snow
